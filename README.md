> I made a small .bat for myself, turning the game mode on and off. Enabling the mode enables the fastest tpfancontrol mode via a hotkey (you need to configure it beforehand), kills services and removes drivers that are bad for gaming. Besides this, it does settings, undervolting, limits cpu watts through XTUcli. Turning off the mode rolls back the changes. I did bat into exe and binded it through lenovo vantage. I also made a GPU Afterburning thing according to your previous guide. I don't have t480 right now, so I couldn't finish it and share with community but I think you can find it useful, but use it carefully as I give no warranty: http://github.com/qrlk/t480-gamemode
